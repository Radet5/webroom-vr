# webroom-vr

WIP

To be a simple peer-networked VR environment with basic physics

Uses three.js and WebXR

The idea is to have a simple base off of which to build--by adding custom assets and possibly game mechanics--a VR website wherein users can interact with one another and a persistent environment

Would also like for non-VR users to still be able to interact in a more limited way via PC or mobile interfaces
